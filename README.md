# Budget-Travelling
Cost minimisation of hotel stays &amp; airplane tickets for a multi-destination round trip.
Hotel and air-ticket fares were scraped from Trivago and Skyscanner, respectively, and choice of hotels and flights for a 2 month round-trip was formulated as an optimisation problem and solved using PuLP

    "The worst part of traveling abroad for holidays is that one has to arrange means of transport and book a hotel. But what if we could automate part of the process?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a list of destinations (multiple ones) in mind, and a predetermined holiday period. Normally, I would go online, and try to book hotels and flights to accomodate my holiday plan, always keeping cost in mind (unfortunately there's a limit to what I can afford). But what if my PC can answer this simple question: Given a list of destinations, can you find me the flights and hotels I need to book, in order to visit a subset of the destinations, as cheap as possible?\n",

    "Sounds like an optimisation problem, right?\n",

    "# Getting the Data\n",

    "First things first, we need to define our destinations. Where would we like to go? Luckily, someone has already answered this for us: [Best places to travel in Europe - 2018](https://www.europeanbestdestinations.com/european-best-destinations-2018/).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the best destinations are the following:\n",
    "- Wroclaw,\n",
    "- Bilbao,\n",
    "- Colmar, \n",
    "- Hvar, \n",
    "- Riga, \n",
    "- Milan, \n",
    "- Athens, \n",
    "- Budapest, \n",
    "- Lisbon, \n",
    "- Bohinj, \n",
    "- Prague, \n",
    "- Kotor, \n",
    "- Paris, \n",
    "- Vienna, \n",
    "- Amsterdam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next question is, when do we want to go on vacation? Let's assume that we have a month available between July 1st, up to and including August 1st.\n",

    "## Searching for hotels\n",
    "<a id=\"hotel_gather\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, to answer the question at hand, we need to know how much it costs to stay in a hotel, at any one of the cities listed above, at any time between July 1st to August 1st. We can scrape the data we need from various websites available. Here, we'll use [Trivago](https://www.trivago.com/). The search page looks like the following:\n",
    "![main_hotel](img/trivago_main.png)\n",
    "Clearly, there are a few steps to take:\n",
    "1. Fire up a browser (obviously)\n",
    "2. Check for captchas or 'enable javascript' error messages (the latter tends to happen on Tor)\n",
    "3. Set our country to USA (It's goof to ensure consistency of the text that appears on the website)\n",
    "4. Set the currency to EUR\n",
    "5. Enter the required destination\n",
    "6. Select our check-in date from the drop-down menu\n",
    "7. Select our check-out date from the dropdown menu\n",
    "8. Grab the best offer\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we have to repeat most steps to gather all the data we need. We'll also implement some 'waiting periods' in-between these actions, as there's no reason to strain the server with our requests. Let's write our scraper using Selenium and the Tor web browser (for info on getting Selenium to work nicely with Tor, check: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15316304/open-tor-browser-with-selenium):\n",

This type of problems can be solved efficiently by a variety of algorithms, from which we can choose and write our own, but there's already a python library we can utilize, called [PuLP](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/). In the following, we'll (a) formulate the optimisation the problem, and (b) solve it using PuLP instead of implementing our own algorithm from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"formulation\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we'll introduce our decision variables, the objective function to be minimised, along with the necessary constraints. We'll also introduce the necessary notation as we go along:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Variables\n",
    "First of all, we need to introduce some notation, along with our decision variables:\n",
    "* $x_{f}^{o,d,t} \\in Z_2^{p(p-1)q}$ are binary decision variables, one for each flight in the dataset, having a value of 1 if a flight is active (i.e. to be taken), or 0 if it is not active. $o$ refers to the outbound city (origin), $d$ refers to the inbound city (destination), and $t$ is the day of travel. The total number of variables is $q$ (number of days in the dataset), times $p(p-1)$, as the same city cannot be an origin and a destination at the same time.\n",
    "* $x_{h}^{o,t_b,t_e} \\in Z_2^{pq(q+1)/2}$ are, again, binary decision variables, one for each hotel, denoted by subscipt $o$ and duration of stay $(t_b, t_e)$, with $t_b$ being the day we'll start occupying a room in the hotel, and $t_e$, the day we'll depart from it. Note that, the number of elements is $p$ (one hotel for each city) times $q(q+1)/2$, which is the number of all possible stay durations (equal to the number of elements in the upper triangle of a square matrix). If, for example, we check-in on the 13th of July, we can only checkout on the days that follow (on the 14th, 15th etc), not the preceding ones (12th, 11th, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "where: \n",
    "* $C$ refers to the set of cities that will be visited, $p$ is the total number of cities, and $c = 0$ is the home node, from which we have to start and finish our trip.\n",
    "* $T$ refers to the set of days between July 1st ($t_0$) to August 1st, with $q$ being the total number of days between our one month time span.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective function\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function is the total cost of our holidays, i.e. cost of every hotel and every flight we take:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$min_{\\bar{x}_f, \\bar{x}_h} = \\sum_{i = 1}^{p} \\sum_{j = 1, j \\neq i}^{p} \\sum_{k = 1}^{q} c_{f}^{i,j,k} x_{f}^{i,j,k} + \\sum_{i = 1}^{p} \\sum_{j = 1}^{q} \\sum_{k = j + 1}^{q} c_{h}^{i, j, k} x_{h}^{i, j, k}$$\n",

    "### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "While the objective function is easy to deduct, the constraints require a bit more work:\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we need to make sure that we start our holidays from the home node, and we also arrive back to the home node at the end of the holiday period. This means that there must be exactly one flight from the home node $c = 0$ (Amsterdam) at time $t = 0$, and exactly one flight towards the home node at the end $t = t_q$. All flights with a different outbound city in the dataset are not allowed:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{align}\n",
    "\\sum_{j = 1}^{p} x_f^{c_0, j, t_0} &= 1 \\\\ \n",

    " \\sum_{j = 1, j \\neq c}^{p} x_f^{j, c, t_q} &= 0,~ \\forall c \\in C\n",
    " \\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we have to make sure that each city is visited at most once (apart from the home node). This also means that there is at most one flight towards every destination, and one flight from every origin:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{align}\n",
    "\\sum_{i = 0}^{q} \\sum_{j = 1 + 1}^{q} x_h^{c, i, j} &\\leq 1,~\\forall \\{c \\in C~|~c \\neq 0 \\} \\\\\n",

    "\\sum_{i = 0}^{p} \\sum_{j = 0}^{q} x_f^{c,i,j} &\\leq 1,~\\forall c \\in C\n",
    "\\end{align} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each hotel stay must be accompanied by the corresponding inbound and outbound flight (there's no way to get to a city without taking a flight towards it, and you can't get out with another flight):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At least $N$ cities will be visited. For cost minimisation (if the problem is formulated properly), this essentially means that exactly $N$ cities will be visited. Furthermore, at least $N + 1$ flights will be taken (+ 1 to return to the home node at the end):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to implement a minimum stay duration of $K$ days at each city , apart from the home node. This means that, if a city is visited on a certain date, we need to restrict all outgoing flights for the next $K$ days. The equality constraints introduced above will then ensure that any other hotel stays for the next $K$ days will be zeroed out. This can be implemented with the following set of big-M constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{i = 1}^{p} \\sum_{j = J}^{q} x_{f}^{c,i,j} \\leq M \\left(1 - \\sum_{i = 1}^{p} \\sum_{j=J}^{J+K} x_{f}^{i,c,k}\\right),~\\forall\\{c \\in C~|~c \\neq 0 \\},~\\forall \\{J \\in T ~| ~J \\leq q - K\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above works for all intermediate nodes. We need to set the following constraints to- and from- the home node:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\sum_{i = 0}^{p} \\sum_{j = 0}^{p} \\sum_{k = 1}^{K} x_f{i,j,k} &= 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\sum_{i = 1}^{p} \\sum_{j = 1}^{K} \\sum_{k = j + 1}^{K+ 1} x_h^{i,j,k} &= 0\n",
